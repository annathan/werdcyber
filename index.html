      <h1>You are probably exposed to cyber risk.<br>You just don’t know where.</h1>
      <p>
        Cyber matters. The problem is not awareness, it is clarity.
        I help business leaders understand their real exposure and what actually needs attention.

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="content">
    <div class="inner">
      <h2>The problem I see every week</h2>
      <p>
        Leaders are told cyber is critical, but the advice they receive is fragmented, technical,
        or driven by tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is uncertainty, delayed decisions, and risk that quietly grows.

      <ul>
        <li>I focus on business risk, not products</li>
        <li>I use the Essential 8 as a benchmark, not a compliance exercise</li>
        <li>I explain what matters in plain English</li>
        <li>You get clarity and a sensible path forward</li>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

        Common questions from business owners, directors, and senior leaders.
      </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What do you mean by security assurance?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Security assurance is an independent check of how well your current approach is working.
            I look at readiness, risk, and obligations, then summarise what is strong, what needs attention,
            and what to do next.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is this for business owners and directors, or IT teams?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This is for decision makers. I work with owners, directors, and senior leaders who need a
            clear view they can act on. I may speak with IT to confirm facts, but the output is written
            for leadership.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How do you use the Essential 8?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            I use it as a benchmark for good practice. I explain each area in plain English and show
            what sensible progress looks like for your size and context.

        <button class="faq-question">What do we receive at the end?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You receive a short, board ready summary showing your current position, key risks in
            business language, and a practical set of next steps.
