  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="band band-light">
    <div class="rail">
      <h2>The problem I see every week</h2>
      <p>
        Leaders know cyber matters, but the advice they receive is fragmented, technical,
        or driven by products and compliance checklists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is uncertainty, delayed decisions, and risk that quietly grows.
      </p>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->

      <h2>What I do differently</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>I start with business risk, not technology</li>
        <li>I use the Essential 8 as a benchmark, not a checkbox exercise</li>
        <li>I explain exposure in plain English</li>
        <li>You leave with clear priorities and next steps</li>

        Common questions from business owners, directors, and senior leaders.

        <button class="faq-question">What do you mean by security assurance?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Security assurance is an independent check of how well your current approach is working.
            I look at readiness, risk, and obligations, then summarise what is strong, what needs attention,
            and what to do next.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is this for business owners or IT teams?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This is for decision makers. I may speak with IT to confirm facts,
            but the output is written for leaders who need clarity they can act on.

            I use it as a benchmark for good practice and explain what sensible progress
            looks like for your size and context.
